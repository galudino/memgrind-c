# memgrind-c
 A benchmarking application for the `cgcs_malloc` memory allocator function.<br>
 (see https://github.com/galudino/cgcs_malloc for the `malloc`/`free` implementation)

To build, you may use `make` in the Terminal with the provided `Makefile`.

`make all` will create both `debug` and `release` versions of `memgrind-c`.
 
`./memgrind_c_debug` will run a `debug` version of the benchmark program.<br>
`./memgrind_c` will run a `release` version.

More details to follow. This repository (and the README) are still under construction.
Thank you for visiting.
